## About The Game

This is a cursor game that has two sides: **Pursuit** and **Evade**. 
In the pursuit mode, you must chase orbs and hover or click over them depending on the setting you chose. It's like an aim trainer!
In the evade mode, you must evade the crosshair that's moving towards your cursor. 
The game switches between these two modes every 15 seconds. Cursor Pursuit is a great way of warming up your arm and aim before hopping onto your favourite game.
